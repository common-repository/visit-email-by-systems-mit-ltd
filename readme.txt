Sends an email notification whenever someone visits your WordPress website.

== Description ==

As a website owner, you understand the importance of tracking your visitors' activity. This information is crucial for making informed decisions about your website content and marketing strategies. However, manually monitoring your website traffic can be time-consuming and inefficient.

That's where **Visit Email by Systems Mit Ltd** comes in. Our simple yet powerful plugin allows you to receive email notifications every time someone visits your WordPress website. These email notifications contain following essential visitor information:

* IP Address
* Device Type
* Location
* Time & Date
* URL Visited

With this data, you can gain a deeper understanding of your audience and optimize your website accordingly.

To ensure you receive these notifications in a timely and reliable manner, we recommend setting up a fluent [SMTP](https://wordpress.com/go/website-building/wordpress-smtp-settings-a-how-to-guide-for-email/) connection. By doing so, you can eliminate the risk of emails being sent to spam folders or not being delivered at all.

Our plugin uses the IP Geolocation API to retrieve the visitor's location information. In cases where the API is not available or the request fails, the location information is not included in the email notification. However, you'll still receive all other valuable visitor information.

**Visit Email by Systems Mit Ltd** is an excellent tool for any website owner who wants to stay on top of their website traffic. It's easy to set up, and the WordPress documentation provides clear instructions on how to configure the [SMTP](https://wordpress.com/go/website-building/wordpress-smtp-settings-a-how-to-guide-for-email/) settings. Download our plugin today and start receiving valuable visitor information straight to your inbox!
